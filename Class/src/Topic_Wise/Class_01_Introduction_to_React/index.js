Defination:
    -> React is a javaScript library for building user interfaces.
    -> The user interface (UI) is the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device. This can include display screens, keyboards, a mouse and the appearance of a desktop
    -> is React Js Library or Framework?
        -> Ract is not a framework. React is a javaScript library for building user interfaces.
    -> It is also known as ReactJS and React.js
    -> React is a Single Page Application

    -> React History
        -> react was first designed by jorden walke, a software engineer at facebook
        -> is was first deployed for facebook news feed around 2011
        -> In 2013, React was Open sourced at JS conference.
        * Open source
            -> An open source project is where the code to a certain project is completely open source. 
            -> That means that anybody can readily see the code that went into a project.
            -> Open source projects also are usually community-based, and accept help from other Programmers.

* About React
    -> Component based approach
        -> A component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every application you will devlop in React will be made up of pieces called components. components make the task of building UIs much easier.
    -> uses a Declarative Approach
        -> Declarative programming is a programming paradigm... that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.
        -> Declarative Programming is like asking your friend to draw a landscape. YOu don't care how they draw it, that's up to them
    -> DOM updates are handled gracefully
    -> Reusable Code
    -> React is designed for speed, speed of implementing the application simplicity and scalability

* Why React?
    -> Created and Maintained by Facebook
    -> it has a huge community on GitHub
    -> Component Based Architecture
