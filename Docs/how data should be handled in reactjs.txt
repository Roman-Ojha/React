In a typical Next.js/React.js application with Redux, the logic for fetching data from the backend and storing it can be divided between the Redux layer and the React component layer. Here's a general guideline for handling data fetching and storing:

React Component Layer:

Components are responsible for rendering UI and handling user interactions.
The component layer can initiate the data fetching process by dispatching an action to Redux.
Components can subscribe to the Redux store to access the fetched data for rendering.
Component-specific state (not application-level state) can be managed using React's local state (useState hook).
Redux Layer:

Redux is responsible for managing the global application state.
Create actions and action creators to describe the data fetching process.
Dispatch these actions from React components to trigger the data fetching process.
Use middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga to handle asynchronous operations.
The middleware intercepts the dispatched actions, performs the API requests, and dispatches new actions with the fetched data.
Create reducers to handle these actions and update the Redux store accordingly.
The fetched data is stored in the Redux store and can be accessed by components through selectors.
So, the overall flow is as follows:

The React component triggers a data fetching action by dispatching it to Redux.
The middleware intercepts the action, performs the API request (GET, POST, etc.), and dispatches new actions (e.g., success, failure) with the fetched data.
The corresponding reducer updates the Redux store with the fetched data.
React components subscribed to the relevant data in the Redux store re-render and access the updated data for rendering.
By following this approach, you separate concerns and keep the data fetching and storing logic in the Redux layer, while the React components focus on rendering UI and handling user interactions.
