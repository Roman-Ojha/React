/*
    *) React Testing Library:
        -> This will allow us to test our react application
    => For this project we have created the 'Todo' application where we except to have certain functionality up on running
        -> for EX: when we type into input field we want the value to be change
            -> and when we click the 'Add' button we would except input field value to disappear and add into todo list
            -> ETC..
        -> here we are testing these thing manually but react-testing-library will allow us to automate these testing
        -> so now all of these test would be written in code
    *) Important of Testing:
        1) Catch Bugs
        2) Increase confidence in application
        3) Speeds up QA time
        4) Can Server as Documentations
