    -> When you would install react app you would get these testing library install automatically:

            "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.1.10",

    -> Inside package.json we have test script:
        -> "test": "react-scripts test",
        -> So, run:
            -> npm run test
        -> and this will run 'App.test.js' file
        -> Note what ever test file name you will write it will test that component
            -> EX: test file name 'Roman.test.js'
            -> now this file will test 'Roman' Component
    -> now let us go to 'App.test.js' and see what is happening there
